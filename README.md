### What it does

This plugin adds a new option called **Item Sources** to the right-click menu of items. Selecting it opens a sidebar panel that scrapes the OSRS Wiki to show you:

* **All Sources:** Every NPC / Activity source, sorted from the most common to the rarest.
* **Shops:** Which shops sell the item, their location, and the price (alphabetically organized, 0 stock shops are excluded).
* **Spawns:** Where the item spawns.

It also allows you to search for an item by typing its name in the search bar and clicking Enter.

### How to use

1. **Right-click** an item in your inventory or equipment and select **Item Sources**.
2. The sidebar will open and display the data. You can click on any source name or location to open that specific Wiki page in your web browser.
3. Alternatively, you can manually type an item name into the **Search** box at the top of the plugin's sidebar.

### Configuration

In the plugin settings, you can toggle which categories (All Sources, Shops, or Spawns) you want to see if, you want to keep the results more focused.
"Shift + Right Click" will enable the "Item Sources" menu entry only when you hold shift and right click the item.
